## 💌 Do-you-wanna?

Welcome to the most extra (and cutest) way to ask your lover out on a date 🥰✨
This is a fun little interactive website where the user is asked "Do you wanna go out with me?" — and guess what?Saying "No" is basically impossible 😂The "No" button runs away. Say "Yes" and you get a cute surprise page ❤️

## How to Use

Clone or download the project Put your own music (MP3) and GIFs if you'd like to personalize itOpen index.html in your browserSend the link to someone special 😏💘

## Ideas to Customize

Add a custom message or poem on the Yes page Replace GIFs with your own memories or inside jokes Make the "No" button get sassier with each hover Add more sound effects, like a “YAY!” after clicking Yes

## ❤ Built With Love

This was made just for fun (and maybe for love too). Spread the romance, write love-powedered code.
